# Fish Feeder

## Overview

The automatic fish feeder enables you to schedule multiple feeding times for your fish. Simply ensure that food is placed in the storage compartmentâ€”the feeder will automatically dispense food at the designated intervals.

## Materials Needed

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (with charging cable)
- 3D-printed parts
- SG90 Servo (Continuous Rotation)

    > **Note:** Most SG90 servos are limited to 180-degree rotation. If this applies to your servo, you can follow the [instructions](../../../docs/hack-servo.md) to modify it for 360-degree rotation.

- 3x Male-to-Female jumper wires

### Software

- Thonny IDE. See the [official documentation](https://thonny.org/).

## Circuit

The schematic may vary depending on your device. For the Raspberry Pi Pico W, refer to the [official pinout documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html#:~:text=Raspberry%20Pi%20Pico%20W%20and%20Pico%20WH).

## 3D Parts and Assembly

Several 3D-printed components are required to build the feeder. You can print these parts from the files in the [3D models](./3D%20models) folder. For the main body, the original piece designed for the Wemos board was removed. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi Pico W case was printed and attached to the main body.

## Code

First, connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W to your IDE by following the [official setup guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/3).

To run the code, you will need the **Servo** object from the **micropython-servo** library:

![Add package](../../../docs/graphics/micropython-servo-lib.png)

Once the package is installed, copy the [main.py](./main.py), [credentials.py.example](./credentials.py.example) (rename to `credentials.py`), and [utils.py](./utils.py) files to your device, and run `main.py` in Thonny IDE.

> [!WARNING]  
> To obtain the Firebase keys required for your `credentials.py` file, refer to the [Firebase setup guide](../../../docs/firebase.md). In addition to the Firebase keys, you must also provide your WiFi SSID and password in this file.
