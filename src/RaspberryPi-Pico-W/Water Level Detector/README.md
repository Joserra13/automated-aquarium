# Water Level Detector

## Overview

Monitoring water level is essential for maintaining a stable aquatic environment. By adding a water level detector to the project, you can accurately measure and track water levels in real time. This enables automated responses, such as refilling the tank or sending alerts, ensuring optimal conditions for aquatic life and preventing issues caused by low water levels.
