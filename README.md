# Automated Aquarium

## Overview

The Automated Aquarium project is designed to transform a traditional aquarium into a smart IoT device. By integrating various sensors and a camera, users can remotely monitor and control multiple aspects of their aquarium environment. Key features include live streaming of the aquarium on Twitch, real-time sensor data visualization, and comprehensive environmental management. The project utilizes a range of technologies, from web development to embedded software.

> **Note:** This is an ongoing project. Features and implementations may evolve over time.

Comprehensive documentation and setup guides are available to assist you in configuring and maintaining your automated aquarium.
