# automated-aquarium

The Automated Aquarium project aims to transform a traditional aquarium into a smart IoT device. By integrating various sensors and a camera, you can monitor and control different aspects of your aquarium remotely. The project includes streaming live footage of the aquarium on Twitch, viewing real-time data collected from the sensors, and managing the aquarium's environment. This project leverages a variety of technologies, ranging from web development to embedded software.

>As this is an ongoing project, features and implementations may evolve over time.

A comprehensive guide with documentation links will be provided to help you set up and maintain your automated aquarium.
